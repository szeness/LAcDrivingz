# LAcDrivingz

the second Gui thing I made after the Black Jack. I tried to get the 2D 3D illusion when a car drives.

the car can be moved left and right, objects coming at him and the street seems moving 

very trashy if u want and not finished at all but first 2D like back in the days I mean 1995 for example. 

also u can hit an object wich comes an then happens nothing special yet but it kinda lands in the trunk.
